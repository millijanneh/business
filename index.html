              My name is Momodou Lamin Janneh, known as milli. For some time now
              I've been offering good value tours to visitors in The Gambia. The
              tours are made privately from two (2) to ten (10) people and it is
              ok say you want it private which promises more personal and
              flexible tours than the big tour operators can offer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Experience The Gambia as well as neighboring Senegal. There are
              half day tours and tours that take up to two days.

                    We contacted Milli from Denmark (saw his good reviews on fb and tripadvisor). He picked us up at the airport and brought us to the hotel in Kololi. We met him in the evening to plan our trips around Gambia. We had certain expectations of what we wanted to see/do (i.e. James Island, the ferry in Banjul, botanical garden, cooking with his family). Additionally, we asked Milli to suggest us interesting sights/things to do based on our interests (i.e. baobab beach, wrestling, bird watching at the Abuko Nature Reserve and awesome local and international food). We worked out a plan that was to our satisfaction. Set prices, times and schedule in advance. All super fair and more than competitive. We experienced so much of the culture during our short stay. We feel that our Gambian experience would have not been this good and integrated if we had not met Milli. Thank you. (jerejef!) so much for being who you are. We wish you the best.

            <blockquote>
                We were looking for things to do on our Holiday in Gambia. At first we were looking at the tours from touroperators and i was willing to book some with them, because the have good reviews. But seacrhing further, we read reviews from people that it is also possible to hire your own tourguide, who will show you arround Th Gambia. There known as the green tourist taxi’s, they are also a “guide”.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                So we searched for a local guide and found ”Milli's tourguide and taxi service in Gambia” through Tripadvisor. After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and on Facebook, we decided to contact Milli. He quickly responded. 
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                We already had a plan in mind and gave it to Milli, he gave us some prices and we decided it was easier to meet up when we arrived at the Hotel (We were staying in Sunset Beach in Kotu).
                So we met up in the hotel and discussed the plan and he said everything was possible what we wanted. Then we made a fair price for everything and the next day we started our first tour.
                
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                The prices are arround the same prices as the big touroperators, some are a little bit higher, some are a little bit lower. But overall it’s about the same. But the big difference is, you have your own personal guide, who is there for you. You are not depending on other people, time schedules etc. You can do everything at your own leisure and you are sponsering a local guide as well. You have your own private tour and we like that.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                Milli arranges everything, the tours are with his own Mercedes or a 4x4 drive if needed (then you get a extra driver and Milli’s sits with you in the back), boats, ticket fees, entrance fees, lunch (with full day excursions), water, soft drinks, snacks. It’s all in the price. He looks after you for the whole day, goes with you to all the places, helps you to negotiate when you want to buy something, shows you things the big touroperators don’t do (he showed us a war cemetery of WWII, because of this we learned that Gambian People also fought in WWII, we never would have knows this if we went with a big tour). He just takes care of you and shows you around. He is very punctual and always on time.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                We really had a great time with Milli, had a lot of talks about everything (never a dull moment and his English is perfect) and had dinner with him. Just to thank him for the great time.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                So if you are in The Gambia, definitely contact Milli and go with him. Everything you want, he can do. He is a great guy to spend the day with. And also one of the savest drivers we have seen in The Gambia (just look at his car, almost no dents or scratches on his car, so that says a lot if you see the other cars in The Gambia 😉). He looks very good after his car and his customers.
